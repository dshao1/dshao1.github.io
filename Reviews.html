'The judges were unanimous in awarding the 1st Prize in Class B to Daniel Shao, for his masterful rendition of the Martin Ballade'<br/>

Review of Eastbourne Young Soloist Competition Final by Robin Gregory, February 2013<br/>
' Until, that is, we heard even younger Daniel Shao play his flute! The Bach Largo was meltingly delicious, and Borne’s Fantasy on Bizet’s Carmen was virtuosic but true to the original.'<br/>
<br/>
Swindon Festival Chronicle, May 2013<br/>
'Brilliant young flautist Daniel Shao played a remarkable piece in tribute to Swindon’s railway heritage complete with whistles and musical steam.'<br/>
<br/>
Swindon Festival of Literature Director's Blog, May 2013<br/>
'To finish the first half, a young man stepped up, smiled, put his flute to his lips, and blew us away. Well, he made me cry, with joy. Daniel Shao played Debussy’s Syrinx; new composer Kristina Arakelyan’s Window to the Street, based on a Franz Kafka poem; and, his two tours de force, The Great Train Race and Zoom Tube. The last two pieces both used the flute in frolicsome ways, with multiphonics, vocal input, and ‘jet-whistling’. This was terrific train stuff, as if written specially for Swindon. We loved it!'<br/>

Comments from judges<br/>
Eastbourne Young Soloist Competition 2013<br/>
'The Bach showed a very sweet sound and some well schooled ornamentation. The Carmen fantasy showed a superb technique with effortless breath control and good projection throughout the range.'<br/>

'A very well prepared performance with great intensity and drama! ... excellent technique'<br/>
<br/>
Robin Kiel (Purcell School Concerto Competition)<br/>
'From the outset, Daniel displayed a brilliant technique with excellent use of dynamics and a secure intonation. He is a lovely, engaging player with good presence. He eloquently and musically conveyed the intensity of moods and emotions in the work alongside superb virtuoso skills. I thought that he created a beautiful tone across the whole range of the instrument. I believe that Daniel displayed real talent that will make him a joy to hear wherever he performs.'<br/>
